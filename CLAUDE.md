# Health of AI — Workspace Map

## START HERE

This workspace is managed by Health of AI OS, a local-first operating system for managing work, projects, and life — powered by flat files, git, and AI.

**→ Before doing anything, read healthofai-os/CLAUDE.md**

That file contains the full operating system: daily check-in workflows, how to process meetings and inbox, how to update dashboards and logs, and how to navigate across all projects below.

## Structure

- **healthofai-os/** — Operating system for everything in this workspace. Always start here.
- **my-work/** — Your work and business projects go here. Add repos, folders, whatever you need.
- **my-projects/** — Your personal projects go here. Courses, side projects, hobbies.

## Navigation Rules

- When opened at this level, always read healthofai-os/CLAUDE.md first
- Git operations for this repo happen at this level
- Sub-folders may contain their own independent git repos — add them to .gitignore if so

## Maintenance

- When new folders are added, update the Structure section above
- Keep this file as a simple routing map — detailed instructions live in healthofai-os/CLAUDE.md
