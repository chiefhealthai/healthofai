# Weekly Review

## Trigger
"Weekly review", "week in review", "how did this week go", "let's review the week", or similar.

## Steps

1. **Read the week's log entries**
   - Read `log/YYYY-MM.csv`
   - Filter for the current week (Monday through today)
   - Categorize: what was completed, what's still open, what was added this week

2. **Read active dashboards**
   - Read `personal/active.md` and `business/active.md`
   - Note what moved forward and what didn't

3. **Read the week's interactions**
   - Read `people/interactions/YYYY-MM.csv` for this week's entries
   - Summarize who you engaged with and key outcomes

4. **Synthesize the week**
   - **What got done**: Completed tasks and wins
   - **What slipped**: Items that were supposed to happen but didn't — note why if apparent
   - **Key decisions made**: Important choices recorded this week
   - **People engagement**: Summary of relationship activity
   - **Patterns**: Any observations about workload, focus, or trends

5. **Archive completed items**
   - Move completed items from `active.md` "Priorities" sections to "Completed" sections
   - Update log entries: mark completed items as `done`

6. **Plan next week**
   - Based on open items, upcoming calendar, and recurring commitments
   - Suggest top 3-5 priorities for next week
   - Flag anything that's been open too long and needs attention or deferral

7. **Monthly archive check**
   - If it's the last week of the month, snapshot the "Completed" sections to archive
   - Create `personal/archive/YYYY-MM.md` and `business/archive/YYYY-MM.md` with completed items
   - Clear the "Completed" sections in active.md

## Inputs
- `log/YYYY-MM.csv`
- `personal/active.md` and `business/active.md`
- `people/interactions/YYYY-MM.csv`
- `reference/recurring.md`
- Google Calendar (if available, for next week's schedule)

## Outputs
- Verbal synthesis of the week
- Updated `active.md` files (completed items archived)
- Updated `log/YYYY-MM.csv` (status updates)
- Optional: monthly archive files
- Suggested priorities for next week

## Notes
- This should take 15 minutes max. Keep the synthesis focused and actionable.
- If the week was overwhelming, say so. Suggest what to cut or delegate.
- If the week was light, note that too — it might mean priorities aren't captured or the system needs updating.
- Celebrate wins. This isn't just a task tracker — acknowledge progress.
